## üî≠ About Me

I'm a physicist and programmer fascinated by the intersection of quantum mechanics, computational physics, and mathematical modeling. Currently exploring Berry phases and topological quantum phenomena through numerical methods.

I'm also a Politics and War player, my nation is [Arghilian](https://politicsandwar.com/nation/id=565128).
You can also find me at Discord: [urterminalted#0000](https://discord.com/users/urterminalted).

## üíª What I Do

- **Quantum Physics Research**: Specializing in Berry phase calculations and topological quantum effects
- **Scientific Computing**: Developing numerical methods for quantum systems using Python
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Creating elegant mathematical formulations for complex physical problems

## üìö Current Projects

- **Arrowhead Matrix Analysis**: Implementing the tau matrix method for Berry phase calculations
- **Quantum Topology**: Exploring topological invariants in quantum systems
- **Scientific Visualization**: Creating intuitive visualizations of complex quantum phenomena
- **Arghilian**: It's a very huge project, involving a creation of the arqhili (formerly nomectosian) language, some Ice Dragonz, and a huge, epic history about what is like to be really a human.

## üå≤ When Not Coding

You'll find me exploring the Hungarian countryside, hiking through forests, or contemplating the universe with a good cup of coffee at a table on our terrace, listening to some music.

## üí¨ Philosophy

I have a large collection of bookz:D
